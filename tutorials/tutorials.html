		<p>In this tutorial you'll learn how easy it is to add style and formatting information to the web pages
using CSS. But, before we begin, make sure that you have some working knowledge of HTML.
If you're just starting out in the world of web development, start learning from here »
Without further ado, let's get started with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p><p>
	Including CSS in HTML Documents
CSS can either be attached as a separate document or embedded in the HTML document itself. There
are three methods of including CSS in an HTML document:
Inline styles — Using the style attribute in the HTML start tag.
Embedded styles — Using the <\style> element in the head section of a document.
External style sheets — Using the <link> element, pointing to an external CSS file.
In this tutorial we will cover all these three methods for inserting CSS one by one.
Note: The inline styles have the highest priority, and the external style sheets have the lowest.
It means if you specify styles for an element in both embedded and external style sheets, the
conflicting style rules in the embedded style sheet would override the external style sheet.

		<p>Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.
